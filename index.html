                </h2>
                <p>Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve my design skills and
                    attract
                    more customers. I wanted to start designing some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and
                    stored
                    on my cell phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more sense with what I
                    thought.
                    I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) made a daily user interface, I really liked the
                    idea, but
                    the problem was that the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.

                        Only when you experience a problem yourself do you understand the frustration of the users and
                        resolve
                        to end it.

                        As designers, we are often afraid of showing work that’s not finished or doesn’t look perfect.
                        You will
                        learn to accept feedback and learn from it.
